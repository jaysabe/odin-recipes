        To craft these vegan wonders, a luscious mixture of plant-based ingredients such as almond or soy milk, vegan butter, and a hint of maple syrup contributes to the dough's richness. As you roll out the dough and generously sprinkle the cinnamon-sugar blend, it becomes a canvas for flavor exploration. The overnight rest ensures that the flavors meld seamlessly, resulting in a batch of soft, pillowy rolls that are not only vegan-friendly but also an exquisite homage to the timeless joy of cinnamon rolls. Enjoy them fresh out of the oven or with a drizzle of vegan cream cheese icing for a truly decadent experience that proves plant-based baking can be just as heavenly.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <h3>Dough:</h3>
        <li>1 cup almond milk</li>
        <li>⅓ cup vegan margarine (such as Earth Balance®)</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons dry egg replacer (such as Bob's Red Mill®)</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>3 cups unbleached or all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>

        <h3>FIlling:</h3>
        <li>½ cup vegan margarine (such as Earth Balance®), melted</li>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon, or to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup maple syrup (optional)</li>

        <h3>Glaze:</h3>
        <li>1 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine almond milk and margarine for dough in a large microwave-safe bowl; microwave on high power for 1 1/2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine water and egg replacer in a bowl; mix well. Let sit for 1 minute to thicken.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, add sugar and yeast to the warm milk mixture and stir to combine. Mix in egg substitute. Add 3 cups flour and salt; mix with your hands until well combined. Add more flour (up to 1 cup) and knead until dough is no longer sticky. Cover bowl with a towel and let rest in a warm place for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Punch down dough and roll on a lightly floured surface into a 12x16-inch rectangle.</li>
        <li>Spread melted margarine over the dough and sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon; smooth filling ingredients with a spoon. Starting at the long edge, roll dough into a log and cut into 12 rolls. (For bigger rolls, roll from the short edge.) Place rolls in a greased pan, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 8 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Remove rolls from the refrigerator, uncover, and allow to warm for 30 to 60 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>When rolls are almost finished, mix confectioners' sugar, water, and vanilla for glaze in a bowl. Spread on warm rolls.</li>
    </ol>
