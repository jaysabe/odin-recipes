    <h2 class="title second">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="list">
        <h3 class="title third">Donuts:</h3>
        <li>1 tablespoon coconut oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 cup gluten-free all-purpose baking flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>1 cup almond milk</li>
        <li>½ cup pumpkin puree</li>
        <li>½ cup coconut sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

        <h3 class="title third">Pumpkin Spice Icing:</h3>
        <li>2 cups powdered sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons almond milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons maple syrup</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="title second">Steps</h2>
    <ol class="list ordered">
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a donut pan with coconut oil.</li>
        <li>Sift flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together into a large bowl. Stir in almond milk, pumpkin puree, coconut sugar, olive oil, cider vinegar, and vanilla until well combined. Transfer batter to a zip-top bag.
        </li>
        <li>Snip off one corner of the bag and pipe batter into the prepared donut pan. If batter is looking a little uneven, carefully shake or tap the pan to settle it.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the donuts comes out clean, about 18 minutes. Cool in the pan for 15 minutes, then remove donuts to a wire rack and cool to room temperature, about 20 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, whisk powdered sugar, almond milk, maple syrup, and pumpkin pie spice in a bowl until smooth.</li>
        <li>Dip cooled donuts into the icing to coat. Refrigerate until icing has set, about 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
