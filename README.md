# Recipe Website Project 

## Introduction

Welcome to the Recipe Website project! In this hands-on coding endeavor, we will be focusing solely on HTML to build the foundation of a basic recipe website. The primary goal is to strengthen your HTML skills, setting the stage for future enhancements with CSS.


## Project Overview 

The project entails creating a main index page featuring links to various recipes. While the end result may not be aesthetically pleasing without CSS this intentional choice allows us to concentrate on the structure and markup aspects of HTML. Think of it as the architectural blueprint before the interior design takes over.

## Skills Demonstrated 

<ol>
  <h4>Upon completion of this project, I will have demonstrated the following skills:</h4>

  <li><strong>HTML Markup:</strong> Mastering the art of structuring web content using HTML tags and elements.</li><br>

  <li><strong>Navigation:</strong> Creating links and establishing navigation between different pages of a website.</li><br>

  <li><strong>Document Structure:</strong> Understanding the importance of a well-organized document structure for better accessibility and readability.</li><br>

  <li><strong>Project Planning:</strong> Translating conceptual ideas into a tangible and functional web project.</li>
</ol>



## Future Steps

As we conclude the initial phase centered around HTML mastery, our journey doesn't culminate here. The next leg of this coding expedition will usher us into the realm of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). This crucial step aims to elevate our basic recipe website from its current functional state to an aesthetically pleasing and polished digital cookbook.

Anticipate delving into the intricacies of design principles, layout styling, and visual enhancements. The meticulous application of CSS will breathe life into our web project, transforming it into a visually appealing and engaging platform.
